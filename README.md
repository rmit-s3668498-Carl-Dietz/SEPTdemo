This is a heavily modified version of the project availble at https://github.com/RMIT-SEPT/majorproject-2-thurs-18-30-3, rebuilt to showcase the code and design work done by group member Carl Dietz.

Consequently many pieces of functionality are disabled and there is no longer any backend support; this is a simple react app which can be run on a local machine. 

In the project directory, use commands:

## `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
